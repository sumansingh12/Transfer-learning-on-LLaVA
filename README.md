# Transfer-learning-on-LLaVA
Transfer Learning on LLaVA — This project applies transfer learning on the LLaVA (Large Language and Vision Assistant) multimodal model to train it for a new custom dataset and domain-specific tasks. The repository includes training scripts, dataset preprocessing, fine-tuning pipelines, evaluation metrics, and inference.
 🚀 Transfer Learning on LLaVA (Large Language and Vision Assistant)

This repository demonstrates **transfer learning / fine-tuning** on **LLaVA**, a powerful multimodal AI model that combines **vision understanding + language reasoning**.  
The goal of this project is to adapt LLaVA to a **custom dataset** and improve performance on domain-specific multimodal tasks.
